        <h1>AR Cup Pong</h1>
        <p>
          Our goal in this project was to create an AR cup pong experience that would be intuitive to use while making the player feel as if it is a real game occuring in AR and not just a 3D game that the user sees through their camera. We did this by making the balls trajectory dependent on the angle of the user's device. This made it so that the user has to aim with the cups not in frame in order to guess the correct trajectory. I worked as a developer in the project and created most of the gameplay mechanics. I also worked with the 3rd party AR library that we used for the project.
